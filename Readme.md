# Popclip extension - Download PDF
In Safari, we are not able to choose the application to open pdf files and thus not able to call Mendeley to import the pdf files in Safari. Although this could be solved by opening firefox, an easier way should be available.

Inspired by the popclip extension and watched folder in mendeley, I wrote this extension to download the pdf files to the watched folder to get around this problem. 

## Requirements
1. Popclip.
2. wget
## Installation
1. Download the DownloadPDF.popclipextz and double click it.
2. Input the absolute path to your Watched Folder of Mendeley Desktop or any folder your want and click OK.
## Usage
1. Select a URL of a pdf file 
2. Wait for the download to finish.
